| Makes the user **trust** the brand right away                                                                                | Makes the user insecure about trusting the brand                                 |
| Increases the user's **perceived value** of the brand or product                                                             | Makes the brand or product seem "cheap"                                          |

#### How to get good typography

`Typefaces`

1. Always use good and popular typefaces and play it safe.

| Sans Serif Font                                                | Serif Font                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ![alt sans serif font](./images/typefaces/sans-serif-font.png) | ![alt serif font](./images/typefaces/serif-font.png) |

2. It's okay to use just one typeface per page. If you want more limit to 2 typefaces.
3. Choose the **right typeface** according to your website personality:<br />
   a. Choose the right personality for website <br />
   b. Decide between a serif and sans-serif typeface <br />
   c. Experiment with all the "good" typefaces to see which ones best fits your website's message <br />
   d. You can keep trying different typefaces as we design and build the page. <br />

`Font size and font weight`

4. When choosing font-sizes, **limit choices** to make life easier. Use a **"type scale" tool** or other **per-defined range**.
5. Use font size between 16px and 32px for **"normal" font**.
6. For **long text** (like blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger.
7. For **headlines**, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), **depending on personality**.
8. For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular)

`Reading Experience`

9. Use less than 75 characters per line.
<figure>
  <img src="./images/readabilities/char-per-line.png" alt="Character Per Line For Readability" width="400" />
  <figcaption>Character Per Line For Readability Purpose</figcaption>
</figure>

10. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5.
<figure>

</figure>

- `NOTE: The smaller or longer the text, the larger the line height needs to be`

11. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural.
12. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and decrease letter-spacing

  <figcaption>Short Title Readability</figcaption>
</figure>

13. Usually, don't justify text.
<figure>

</figure>

14. Don't center long text blocks unless these blocks are small.

### Website Personalities
