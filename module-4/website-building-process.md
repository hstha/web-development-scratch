# Website Building Process:

- Before building any website, we should follow the following 7 steps:
  1. Define
  2. Plan
  3. Sketch
  4. Design and Build
  5. Test And Optimize
  6. Launch
  7. Maintain and Update

## Define

- Define `WHO the website is for`.
  - Eg: Is it for yourself? For a client of your agency or your freelancing business?
- Define `WHAT the website is for`. In other words, define `business and user goals` of your website project.
  - Eg: What are you trying to provide from with help of your website and what does users do when they visit your website.
- Define a `target audience`. Be really specific if possible and if it makes sense for your website.
  - Eg: What kind of users are you targeting like their age, income, living place, etc

## Plan The Project

- Plan and gather `website content`: text, images, videos, etc.
- Content is usually `provided by the client`, but you also can help them produce and find some content (simply finding free images is easiest, but if they want whole content, charge them extra)
- For bigger sites, plan out the `sitemap`: what pages the site needs, and how they are related to one another (content hierarchy)
- Based on the content, plan what `sections` each page needs in order to convey the content's message, and in which order. `Never design ahead, always design as per the content`.
- Define the `website personality`

## Sketch

- Think about what `components` you need, and how you can use them in `layout patterns`.
- Get ideas out of your head: sketch them with `pen and paper` or with some design software (e.g: `Figma`).
  - You don't have fill the whole content, just the boxes (components) you need and how it should be placed
- This is an iterative process: experiment with different components and layouts, until you arrive at a first good solution.
  - Meaning you don't have you design everything upfront.
  - If you can design some section and code.
  - By doing this you can fix the mistakes early in the development that you might encounter while coding and fix the problems in the design
  - Remember, `Nobody is perfect they are just more experienced`.

## Design and Build Website

- Use decisions, content and sketches from step 1, 2 and 3 to code the design
- You already have the `layout` and `components` that you selected in Step 3. In this step, you need to design the actual visual styles.
- Create the design based on selected `website personality` by following design guidelines and taking inspiration.
  - `Inspiration` must be taken in step 3
- Use the client's branding (it if exists already) for design decisions whenever possible: `colors`, `typography`, `icons`, etc.

## Test and Optimize

- Make sure website works well in all major browsers (`Chrome, Firefox, Edge`)
- Test the website on `actual mobile devices`, not just in DevTools
- Optimize all `images`, in terms of dimensions and file size
- Run the `Lighthouse` performance test in Chrome DevTools and try to fix reported issues
- If possible think about `Search Engine Optimization` (SEO)

## Launch

- Once all work is done, everything is perfect, and you got approval from your client, it's time to `launch the website`
- Upload your website files to a `hosting platform`.
- Choose and buy a great `domain name`, one that represents the brand well, is memorable and easy to write.

## Maintain and Update

- Launching is not the end.
- Keep the website content `updated over time`. If you're working with a client, you can create a monthly maintenance contract.
- Install `analytics software` (e.g. `Google Analytics` or `Fathom`) to get statistics about website users. This may `inform future changes` in the site structure and content.
